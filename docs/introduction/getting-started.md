# 🚀 Absolutely Awesome React Components & Libraries

This is a list of AWESOME components. Nope, it's NOT a comprehensive list of
every React component under the sun. So, what does "awesome" mean? Well:

- It solves a real problem
- It does so in a 🦄 unique, 🦋 beautiful, or 🏆 exceptional way. (And it's not super popular and well-known... no point in listing those.)
- It has recent code commits!

Look for a 🚀 for truly amazing projects. And look for quickie maintainer
commentary and reviews in _(italic parens)_ after some listings of note.

Maintainers:

- [@petebray](https://github.com/bluepeter), author of [Fluxguard](https://fluxguard.com) &mdash; monitor PROD website changes.
- [@brillout](https://twitter.com/brillout), author of [vite-plugin-ssr](https://vite-plugin-ssr.com/) (like Next.js / Nuxt but as do-one-thing-do-it-well Vite plugin) and [Telefunc](https://telefunc.com/) (remote functions instead of APIs).
